***

I am currently a Finance PhD student at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University.

I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Bradley University with Bachelors degrees in Mathematics and Finance. I continued on at Bradley to obtain a Master of Science in Quantitative Finance, graduating with distinction.

### Hobbies

There are times I need to get away from the writing, the reading, the math, and the endless hours of sitting in general. In those times, I like tinkering with my electronics, developing a new piece of software, or getting outdoors.

As you can see on my [Projects](/projects/) page, I sometimes feel the need to just make something new and share it with the world. I hope to eventually contribute things that are actually useful!

I am an avid runner and fitness junkie. When I'm not at home or in the office, I'm more than likely at the gym or out on a run. 

Sports are about the only thing I find enjoyable to watch on TV, and I follow the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Blackhawks, and the Chicago Bears (can you tell I'm from the midwest yet?). Soccer is probably my favorite sport to watch, but the only team I'll give my fandom to is the US National Team. If any US or European clubs would be interested in signing me on as a fan, send me an offer.
